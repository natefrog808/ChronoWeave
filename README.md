# ChronoWeave: Interactive Historical Tapestry

## 🚀 Time Travel Simulation Platform

*Because who needs a DeLorean when you've got React?*

## 🌟 Overview

An interactive historical simulation platform that lets you explore the butterfly effects of major historical events. Watch as the Industrial Revolution spawns railways, social reforms ripple through centuries, and that one time someone decided steam engines were a good idea changed everything.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Interactive Timeline
- Dynamic event visualization spanning from 1800 onwards
- Cause-and-effect relationships between historical events
- Real-time impact calculations on society, economy, and technology
- No paradoxes included (we checked)

### 🔍 Advanced Filtering
- Filter by event categories:
  - Technological breakthroughs (without the explosions)
  - Social reforms (now with 100% less guillotines)
  - Political events (drama included)
  - Economic changes (stonks 📈)

### 📊 Impact Visualization
- Color-coded event categories
- Dynamic connection lines showing event relationships
- Impact meters showing how each event affects:
  - Economy (money printer go brrr)
  - Society (people doing people things)
  - Technology (from steam to memes)
  - Education (now with fewer chalk duels)
  - Health (before and after washing hands was cool)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - Because regular React wasn't meta enough
- **TypeScript** - For when you want your errors before runtime
- **Tailwind CSS** - CSS classes longer than your commit messages
- **shadcn/ui** - Making things pretty since whenever shadcn decided to make things pretty
- **Lucide Icons** - Icons that don't look like they're from 1800

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (preferably not running on a steam engine)
- npm (or yarn, we don't judge)
- A basic understanding of time (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (no time machine required)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timeline-simulation.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd timeline-simulation

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` - Your personal time machine awaits!

## 🎮 Usage

1. Select a time period (1800-1850)
2. Hover over events to see their details and connections
3. Use filters to focus on specific types of events
4. Watch as history unfolds without accidentally becoming your own grandfather

## 🧪 Key Components

### AdvancedTimeline
The heart of our time machine. Handles:
- Event rendering
- Timeline navigation
- Impact calculations
- Paradox prevention (mostly)

### TimelineEvents
Where we keep our historical data, carefully curated to be:
- Historically accurate
- Interconnected
- Butterfly effect compliant

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- The Industrial Revolution (for making this all possible)
- That butterfly that flapped its wings in 1800
- All the historians who carefully documented everything so we could make this simulation
- Coffee (for obvious reasons)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Still can't actually travel through time (working on it)
- May cause mild historical addiction
- Occasional quantum entanglement with the coffee machine
