*Because who needs a DeLorean when you've got React and TypeScript?*

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to ChronoWeave, where we turn "butterfly effect" from a cool theory into a "hold my beer" moment. Watch as the Industrial Revolution snowballs through time, and that one person who decided steam engines were a good idea changes literally everything.


## ✨ Features That Make Time Lords Jealous

### 🎯 Core Features
- Interactive timeline visualization (no quantum physics degree required)
- Real-time cause-and-effect simulation
- Branching history paths (paradox-free™)
- Dynamic impact calculations that would make your math teacher proud
- Dark mode that's darker than the Dark Ages

### 🔮 Smart Historical Analysis
- Advanced event relationship mapping
- Impact propagation across timelines
- Real-time metric calculations
- Automatic paradox prevention system (sorry, you can't become your own grandfather)

### 🎨 UI Components That Time Forgot
- Fully accessible UI (screen-reader friendly for time travelers from all dimensions)
- Theme support smoother than a temporal vortex
- Responsive design that works in any timeline
- Component variants that would make Darwin proud

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Time-Tested™)

- **Next.js** - Because even time travel needs server-side rendering
- **TypeScript** - For when you need to type-check across centuries
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling quantum mechanics made easy
- **shadcn/ui** - Components that look good in any timeline
- **CVA** - For variants that adapt faster than evolution

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (temporal coordinates included)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chronoweave.git

# Travel to the project directory
cd chronoweave

# Install dependencies (time-travel safe)
npm install

# Launch the temporal viewer
npm run dev
```

```

## 🎮 Usage

```typescript
// Import from any temporal dimension
import { AdvancedTimeline } from '@/components/timeline/AdvancedTimeline';

// Deploy your temporal viewer
export default function TimeTravel() {
  return (
    <div className="temporal-container">
      <AdvancedTimeline />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎨 UI Components

Our enhanced UI components come with:
- Automatic dark mode detection (works in any century)
- Keyboard navigation (for time travelers who prefer keyboards)
- Screen reader support (because accessibility shouldn't be history)
- Color contrast utilities (visible across the space-time continuum)

```typescript
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card';

// Example of our enhanced card component
<Card 
  variant="elevated"
  isHoverable
  isInteractive
>
  Time-traveling content goes here
</Card>
```

## 🧪 Features in Detail

### Enhanced Theme Management
```typescript
const { theme, updateTheme } = useTheme();
// Supports 'light', 'dark', and 'system' preferences
// Persists across timeline jumps
```

### Accessibility Features
- ARIA attributes that make sense in any century
- Keyboard navigation that would make HTML proud
- Screen reader descriptions that tell the whole story
- Focus management smoother than a temporal slip

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient class name generation
- Memoized components
- Bundle size smaller than a temporal paradox
- Smoother than a well-oiled time machine

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Still can't actually travel through time (working on it)
- May cause mild historical addiction
- Side effects may include: temporal vertigo, historical curiosity, and the urge to prevent the invention of Comic Sans
